# Online Party Chat
A mod I created for the game A Hat in Time, it was removed from the Steam Workshop, I think it was removed because of things some people said using it. Seems unfair to me so decided to share it here.

# installation
To get the mod to work the files should be placed in SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\HatinTime\HatinTimeGame\Mods\OnlineChat
to get there, right click the game in you steam library, then click the local files tab and click browse local files, then navigate to the "mods" folder and create a folder called "OnlineChat".

# Note to people who make mods for this game:
When using this mod in the editor, you might get rick rolled due to a bug. This is actually a bug in the editor, not in this mod, i might add a workaround.
( The reason this happens is because of the ban system, if a banned user tries to use the mod they'll get rick rolled, but the thing that checks if the user is banned uses a function that doesn't work in the editor but does work in-game. )
