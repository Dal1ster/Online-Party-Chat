# Online Party Chat
A mod I created for the game A Hat in Time, it was removed from the Steam Workshop, I think it was removed because of things some people said using it. Seems unfair to me so decided to share it here.

To get the mod to work the files should be placed in SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\HatinTime\HatinTimeGame\Mods\OnlineChat
to get there, right click the game in you steam library, then click the local files tab and click browse local files, then navigate to the "mods" folder and create a folder called "OnlineChat".
