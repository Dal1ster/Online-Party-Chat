# Online Party Chat
A mod I created for the game A Hat in Time, it was removed from the Steam Workshop, I think it was removed because people abused it (even tho I banned the person who abused it), but I'm not sure because the creators of the game won't tell me.

To get the mod to work the files should be placed in SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\HatinTime\HatinTimeGame\Mods\OnlineChat
to get there, right click the game in you steam library, then click the local files tab and click browse local files, then navigate to the "mods" folder and create a folder called "OnlineChat".
